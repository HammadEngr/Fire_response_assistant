# ----- WHAT IS FIRE -----
WHAT_IS_FIRE = """🔥 WHAT IS FIRE?

Fire is a rapid chemical process in which oxygen combines with another substance (fuel) in the presence of a source of heat.

This reaction is called COMBUSTION.

During this reaction, three things are produced:
• Heat
• Flames
• Smoke

Understanding this helps us know how to prevent and fight fires."""

# ----- FIRE TRIANGLE -----
FIRE_TRIANGLE = """🔺 THE FIRE TRIANGLE

Fire needs THREE elements to exist:

🪵 FUEL
• Any combustible material
• Wood, paper, cloth, gas, oil, etc.
• Consumed during burning

💨 OXYGEN
• Present in air at 21% concentration
• Fire needs at least 16% oxygen to burn
• More oxygen = more intense fire

🔥 HEAT (Ignition Source)
• Energy needed to start combustion
• Sources: flames, sparks, friction, electricity, sun

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Remove ANY ONE element = Fire STOPS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

This is the basis of all firefighting methods."""

# ----- FIRE CLASSIFICATION -----
FIRE_CLASSIFICATION = """📋 FIRE CLASSIFICATION (UK/EU System)

Fires are classified by the type of fuel:

CLASS A - Solid Materials
• Wood, paper, cloth, plastic
• Most common type of fire

CLASS B - Liquids & Liquefiable Solids
• Petrol, oil, paint, wax
• Spread rapidly, can float on water

CLASS C - Gases
• Propane, butane, natural gas
• Explosion risk

CLASS D - Metals
• Magnesium, sodium, potassium, aluminium
• Burn at extremely high temperatures
• React violently with water

CLASS F - Cooking Fats/Oils
• Deep fryers, cooking equipment
• Very high temperature fires

⚠️ Note: No Class E in UK/EU system.
Different countries may use different classification systems."""

# ----- HOW FIRE SPREADS -----
FIRE_SPREAD = """🌊 HOW FIRE SPREADS

Fire spreads through 4 methods:

1️⃣ DIRECT BURNING
• Flames touch new fuel source
• Most obvious method
• Example: Fire spreading along curtains

2️⃣ CONVECTION
• Hot air rises, carries heat upward
• Why fires spread quickly UP stairs/shafts
• Most dangerous in buildings
• Hot gases collect at ceiling level

3️⃣ CONDUCTION
• Heat travels through solid materials
• Metal conducts heat very well
• Example: Fire spreads through metal pipes/beams

4️⃣ RADIATION
• Heat travels through air as invisible waves
• No contact needed
• Can ignite materials at distance
• Example: Nearby furniture catches fire from radiant heat

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Convection is the PRIMARY cause of fire spread in buildings
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"""

# ----- CONSEQUENCES -----
FIRE_CONSEQUENCES = """⚠️ CONSEQUENCES OF FIRES

HUMAN IMPACT
• Deaths - smoke inhalation is #1 killer
• Burns and injuries
• Psychological trauma
• Long-term health effects from smoke

PROPERTY DAMAGE
• Structural damage to buildings
• Destruction of contents
• Smoke damage (often worse than fire)
• Water damage from firefighting

ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE
• Air pollution from smoke
• Water contamination from run-off
• Soil contamination
• Wildlife and habitat destruction

BUSINESS IMPACT
• Loss of production
• Job losses
• Reputation damage
• Legal consequences

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
80% of businesses that suffer major fire never recover
